This game is about three guys, how they struggled in the beginning and realised their true potential and overcame their fear of python.(Created as Project. Members Saikiran,Sanjay,Phani)
It starts out with an alien invasion where the earth is almost doomed it's upto the player to save earth.
the only way to do so is fighting fire with fire so we have to invade their planet and stop them from taking over Earth.
It causes a singularity and rips apart the timeline creating a Alternate Universe .Our Universe.
