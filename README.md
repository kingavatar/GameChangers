# The Game Changers

This game is about three guys, how they struggled in the beginning and realized their true potential, and overcame their fear of python. This game was created as a Project for Python Course. It is a total of three games with cut scenes and music.

It starts out with an alien invasion where the earth is almost doomed it's up to the player to save the earth. The only way to do so is fighting fire with fire so we have to invade their planet and stop them from taking over Earth. It causes a singularity and rips apart the timeline creating an Alternate Universe. Our Universe.
